# Nomad-Archive

This repository contains fragments of an experimental system developed
as part of the SilentNomad project.

The original goal was to prototype a lightweight execution environment
capable of interpreting nomadic instruction streams.

Much of the documentation has been lost.
Several components are incomplete or intentionally left ambiguous.

# Contents
-Lost experiments
-cryptographic routines
-Abandoned payloads

# Notes
-Instruction format changed multiple times
-Test vectors may appear meaningful but are not guaranteed to decode
-Some artifacts are preserved for historical reasons only

## Status
This project is no longer maintained.
